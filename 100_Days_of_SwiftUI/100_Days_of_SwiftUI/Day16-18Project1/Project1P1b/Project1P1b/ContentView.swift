                             @State allows us to work around the limitation of structs: we know we canâ€™t change their properties because structs are fixed, but @State allows that value to be stored separately by SwiftUI in a place that can be modified
                             
                             
                             - @State is specifically designed for simple properties that are stored in one view. As a result, Apple recommends we add private access control to those
