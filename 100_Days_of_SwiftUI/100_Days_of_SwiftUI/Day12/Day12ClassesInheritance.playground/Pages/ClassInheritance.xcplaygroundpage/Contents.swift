     Override Rules:
     1) If you attempt to change a method without using override, Swift will refuse to build your code. This stops you accidentally overriding a method.
     2) If you use override but your method doesnâ€™t actually override something from the parent class, Swift will refuse to build your code because you probably made a mistake.
