/*
 1) Variables and constants that belong to structs are called properties.
 2) Functions that belong to structs are called methods.
 3) When we create a constant or variable out of a struct, we call that an instance â€“ you might create a dozen unique instances of the Album struct, for example.
 4) When we create instances of structs we do so using an initializer like this: Album(title: "Wings", artist: "BTS", year: 2016).
