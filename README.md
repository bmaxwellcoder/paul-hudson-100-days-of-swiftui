# 100 Days of SwiftUI

This repository contains my progress and projects from Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course.

## About the Course

The 100 Days of SwiftUI is a free collection of videos, tutorials, tests, and more, all designed to help beginners learn SwiftUI effectively. The course is structured to be completed over 100 days, with each day requiring about one hour of focused learning.

## Rules

1. Every day, spend one hour reading or watching SwiftUI tutorials, or writing SwiftUI code.
2. Every day, post about your progress to the social media site of your choosing.

- Take your time - it's a marathon, not a sprint.
- Avoid "shiny object syndrome" - stick with this course.
- Don't learn alone - ask for help when needed.
- Use the consolidation days to review what you've learned.
- Refer to the [glossary of common Swift terms](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/glossary).
- Use [SwiftUI by Example](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui) for reference.
- Download the free [Unwrap app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1440611372) for additional practice.
